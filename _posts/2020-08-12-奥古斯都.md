### 知识的贯通
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;两个不同领域的知识融合，往往会产生奇妙的反应。掌握一门知识，再去学习另外一门知识，往往也有奇特的效果。比如经济学家学王朝兴衰史，会透过英雄人物的登台表演，挖掘帝国的财政危机，发现朝代更替的真相。

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;2009年有一道题目，假如你的政治理论知识很系统很扎实，那么你很容易做对。

<br>
原文：

```$xslt
What is the real relationship between education and economic development? 
We have to suspect that continuing economic growth promotes the development of education even when governments don't force it. 
After all, that's how education got started. 
When our ancestors were hunters and gatherers 10,000 years ago, they didn't have time to wonder much about anything besides finding food. 
Only when humanity began to get its food in a more productive way was there time for other things.
```
<br>
题目:

```$xslt
 The author quotes the example of our ancestors to show that education emerged __________.

　　[A] when people had enough time

　　[B] prior to better ways of finding food

　　[C] when people on longer went hung

　　[D] as a result of pressure on government

```

<br/>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;一个很朴素又很需要理解的概念：经济基础决定上层建筑。经济基础是指 `由社会一定发展阶段的生产力所决定的生产关系的总和，是构成一定社会的基础` ；上层建筑是`建立在经济基础之上的意识形态以及与其相适应的制度、组织和设施，在阶级社会主要指政治法律制度和设施`。原文中，能够让人不再挨饿（`people on longer went hung`）就是经济基础，教育（`education`）就是上层建筑。所以答案选C。然而当年绝大多数考生选了A。选A的同学，读懂了英语，却没有读懂政治。
